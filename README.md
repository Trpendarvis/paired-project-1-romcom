# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?) In this project we built several buttons each with their own unique functionality. This app(webpage) allowed the user to create and make their own custom book cover, title, and descriptions and well as view random book covers, titles, and descriptions. We were also able to create a way to save cover images for a user with the click of a button.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The whole project is on github a person would be able to go to https://github.com/Trpendarvis/paired-project-1-romcom and fork our project. To create further functionality in the save button function variables would need further defining so that saved images, titles, and descriptions would not be shown as "undefined". An if statement is required to not allow the same image to be saved more than once. The final piece of functionality would be the ability to delete any saved images with a double click which would require a new event listener and a new function.
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
On average this project took around 4-6 hrs / day for the week it was given. Currently we are on mod 1 week 2.
### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals of this project was to use the DOM to build a functional webpage using CSS, HTML, and JS. This project required us to use all lessons learned within this first 2 weeks of Turing.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We had a lot of wins on this project; learning how to research to find new information via the web (web3 and MDN), working successfully in a paired programing environment, and using all new information to make something functional even though we were not able to complete it 100%.
